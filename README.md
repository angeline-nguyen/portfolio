# Portfolio

## About

This portfolio site is an assignment for my full stack development program. I am using another repository rather than hosting it directly at www.angeline-nguyen.com because the amount of time I have for this assignment is less than I would like to spend on my official portfolio.

At this point in time, I also have completed fewer projects and learned less back-end development than I would like prior to creating my portfolio. This portfolio is thus focused on front-end development, a bit sparse, and, due to the time constraint, has a higher ratio of Bootstrap to custom CSS than I would normally employ.

Once my comprehensive portfolio is completed, I will update this README to link to that.
